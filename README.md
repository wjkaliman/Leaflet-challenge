# Leaflet-challenge
The Leaflet Challenge was to pull a dataset from the USGS website on earthquakes. I used the USGS GeoJSON feed for all earthquakes over the last 30 days. I then used JavaScript, Leaflet, HTML and CSS to plot all the earthquakes based on there longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color. Popups were included to provide additional information about the earthquakes when a marker is clicked. There is a legend in the bottom right corner that displays context for the map.
